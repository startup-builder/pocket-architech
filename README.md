Pocket ArchiTech - A startup architect at the palm of your hands!

Our goal is to create a startup infra from scratch through our cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)

Things that I need to learn:
- Design a Prototype (ideally via Figma)
- Try out the AWS API (create an MVP)
- Expand to Other DevOps stuffs
